# expense_planner

My first real Flutter/Dart App, made during the training of Flutter And Dart on course.  
 
  Application contains chart bar of weekly expenses and list of expenses(transactions). It's fully functional with adding new transactions, deleting existing transactions and scrolling list of transactions. App uses; libraries: flutter/material.dart, intl.dart; fonts: OpenSans, Quicksand and one simply image for view without any transactions. I think, a lot of code is commented and simply for reading. A few of comments are in Polish for better understanding for myself.
